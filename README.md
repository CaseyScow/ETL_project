# ETL_project
For the ETL project, I worked with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
